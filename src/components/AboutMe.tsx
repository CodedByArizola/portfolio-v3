                    Hi, my name is Alex.
                    I'm a graduate of North Creek High School and currently an undergraduate at Lake Washington Institute of Technology, pursuing a degree in Computing and Software Development.
                    My goal is to complete my Associate of Applied Science degree and continue on to earn my Bachelor's.
                    In my free time, I enjoy coding, listening to music, watching sunsets, spending time with my dogs Charlie and Marcie, and staying active at the gym.

                    Since November 2019, I have gained hands-on experience in the software engineering field through freelance projects, delivering solutions across various areas and deepening my technical expertise.
                    Despite not yet having formal work experience in the tech industry, I have built a strong skill set in programming and software development.
                    I am proficient in languages such as Lua, TypeScript, and SQL, and I have experience working with frameworks like jQuery and React.
                    Additionally, I am familiar with GitHub for version control, enabling effective collaboration and project management.

                    As part of my studies at Lake Washington Institute of Technology, I am expanding my knowledge by learning languages such as C#, Python, and Java.
                    These academic and freelance experiences have honed my technical abilities, strengthened my adaptability, and equipped me with problem-solving skills to handle diverse and challenging tasks.
